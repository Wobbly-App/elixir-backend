## üíª Up and running

We recommend using VS Code (this repo comes with a few recommended extensions), but it's optional.
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

### Prerequisites - MacOS
* `brew install elixir gd libyaml
* (when getting dependencies you may have to prefix the `mix` command with `env LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib" CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include" `

## üî• Testing
TODO.
Just run `mix test`. Make sure you have a Postgres database running.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing
All CI checks must pass for PRs to be merged. These checks are a lot more likely to succeed if you run `mix format` (to auto-format code), `mix credo` (to check code style), and `mix test` before pushing.

## üêõ Debugging
Running into issues with the VS Code debugger? Try deleting the `.elixir_ls`, `deps`, and `_build` folders and restarting VS Code.
